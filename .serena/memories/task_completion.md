# Task Completion Checklist
- Run `npm run build` before submitting changes; ensure Prisma migrations are applied when schema changes occur.
- Manually verify registration, login/logout, profile edits, subject tab switching, personalized document editing/regeneration, and chat flows.
- Document new environment variables, schema shifts, or workflow updates in relevant `docs/` entries and PR notes.
- Keep commits focused with imperative summaries; mention migrations or UI changes in commit bodies when needed.
